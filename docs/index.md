**One sentence on impact:** Tribal groups want to collaborate to create pragmatic tools to better understand information to protect their land, resources, and sovereignty.

## Day 1 ‚Äî Define & Explore
### Our product üì£
- A dashboard/interactive search tool to more easily comb through 2,400 Environmental Impact Statement/Assessment documents from the US Forest Service, US NRC, BLM, etc.

### Our question(s) üì£
- How can we create a tool for non-technical tribal decision-makers to access and understand meaningful information about extractive activities in the HeSapa through EIAs?


### Hypotheses / intentions


### Why this matters (the ‚Äúupshot‚Äù) üì£
- HeSapa is sacred land to tribes and exposed to extractives activities 
- The information will be accessible to non-technical audiences
- Supports corporate accountability & transparency; environmental justice; and treaty rights around extractive activities in the HeSapa



### Inspirations (papers, datasets, tools)

### Field notes / visuals

## Day 2 ‚Äî Data & Methods
*Focus: tribal engagement to identify key indicators of concern, human-review of a typical EIS, metadata capture, intial steps of PDF extraction.*

### Data sources we‚Äôre exploring üì£
- Public documents (PDFs) such as Environmental Impact Statements and Assessments from agencies such as Forest Service, EPA, US NRC, BLM.

  *Snapshot: EIS for the Dewey-Burdock Project for In-Site Leach Uranium Milling Facilities.*

### Methods / technologies we‚Äôre testing üì£
1. **Engagement**: Engaged with the tribal members to identify key indicators of concern and desired product output.
2. **Centralize and Structure the Data**:
   - PDF Extraction: Use Python/R to extract relevant test from PDFs.
   - Metadata capture: For each EIS/EA document determine the most relevant information to capture:
      - Document title
      - Agency names
      - Company name(s)
      - Geographical project location/coordinates
      - Type of extractive activity (e.g., mining, forestry)
      - Byproducts from extractive activities (e.g., contaminants or residues)
      - Key environmental impact categories 
    - Spreadsheet/Database: Store this data in a structured format (CSV) so it can be filtered and searched.
3. **Automate Key Information Extraction**:
   - Create training set for any LLM models.
   - Keyword Tagging: Use models to flag mentions of relevant fields.
4. **Build a Long-Term Knowledge Sharing Base**
   - Build a dashboard that can tribal leaders can use for more evidence-based decision-making.
   - Overlay project sites (pending necessary geograhpical coordinate data) to visualize where activities intersect with culturally and ecologically sensitive areas.

### Challenges identified
- Missing information: Certain projects were waived from creating EIS/EA for categorical exclusion.
- If any PDFs are not machine-readable, integrate OCR.
- Writing a generalized code that can effectively parse through PDFs of various formats to capture necessary data.
- Does the language used in the metadata schema reflect tribal community values?

## Final Share Out ‚Äî Insights & Sharing

### Visuals that tell the story üì£
![Atlas cards for high-priority ideas](assets/dewey_burdock_hazard_matrix.png)

*Visual 1.* Potential chemicals and their risk from Dewey Burdock Project.

### Findings at a glance üì£
- **Key priority areas for tribes:** Impact of extractive activites on historical resources, cultural sites, wildlife (bison), water bodies, soil, air, plant life, and broader ecosystems
- **Test and refine workflow with a handful of human-reviewed EIS/EAs:** human review of PDFs compares to machine-generated PDF parse results for accuracy and quality.
- **Deeper Knowledge of the Land:** Work with tribal partners to understand the language of the land.



### What‚Äôs next? üì£
- Refine the PDF search tools, LLM, etc.
- Broader group: ESIIL Working Group & CU Boulder Research & Innovation Seed Grant Program
