**One sentence on impact:** In three days we surface wildcard ideas from across the Innovation Summit and translate them into prototypes, visuals, and next-step pilots that decision makers can act on.

## How to use this page (for the team)
- **Edit this file:** `docs/index.md` ‚Üí ‚úé ‚Üí change text ‚Üí **Commit changes**.
- **Add images:** upload to `docs/assets/` and reference like `assets/your_file.png`.
- Keep **text short** and **visuals first**. Think ‚Äústoryboard captions,‚Äù not full reports.

## Day 1 ‚Äî Define & Explore
### Our product üì£
- A dashboard/interactive search tool to more easily comb through 2,400 Environmental Impact Statement/Assessment documents from the US Forest Service, US NRC, BLM, etc.

### Our question(s) üì£
- How can we create a tool for non-technical tribal decision-makers to access and understand meaningful information about extractive activities in the HeSapa through EIAs?


### Hypotheses / intentions


### Why this matters (the ‚Äúupshot‚Äù) üì£
- HeSapa is sacred to multiple tribes
- The information will be accessible to non-technical audiences
- Supports corporate accountability & transparency; environmental justice; and treaty rights around extractive activities in the HeSapa



### Inspirations (papers, datasets, tools)

### Field notes / visuals

*Caption: Mapping questions from the first round of ideation to identify gaps in our wildcard atlas.*

> **Different perspectives:** We debated whether to focus on one flagship prototype or map the broader landscape. The atlas approach won because it keeps doors open for other teams to plug in.

---

## Day 2 ‚Äî Data & Methods
*Focus: ingest submissions, prototype clustering + scoring, ship a first visual.*

### Data sources we‚Äôre exploring üì£
- Public documents (PDFs) such as Environmental Impact Statements and Assessments from agencies such as Forest Service, EPA, US NRC, BLM.

  ![First look at wildcard clustering output](assets/explore_data_plot.png)
[Raw photo location: explore_data_plot.png](https://github.com/CU-ESIIL/wildcard-topic-innovation-summit-2025__20/blob/main/docs/assets/explore_data_plot.png)
  *Snapshot: BERTopic clusters highlighting recurring needs around monitoring, storytelling, and rapid response.*

### Methods / technologies we‚Äôre testing üì£
- Engaged with Lakota tribe to identify what matters most while parsing EIS/EA documents with the aim to document the schema in a simple table format to iteratively update:
  **Example Fields:**
    - Document title
    - Agency names
    - Company names (to ensure accountability)
    - Geographical location (e.g., mention of states, cities, counties, reservations, or watersheds impacted)
    - Byproducts from extractive activities (e.g., contaminants or residues such as chemicals, pollutants, radioactive elements)
    - Mentions of treaty rights
    - Impact on historical resources or cultural sites
    - Impact on wildlife
    - Impact on acquifer/groundwater, soil, air quality, plant life, and broader ecosystems
- Use Python/R to extract relevant text from PDFs. For scanned PDFs, integrate OCR.
- Retrieval and LLM workflow.
- Provide a dashboard view for easy access.

### Challenges identified
- Missing information: Certain projects were waived from creating EIS/EA for categorical exclusion.
- Writing a generalized code that can effectively parse through PDFs of various formats to capture necessary data.
- Does the language used in the metadata schema reflect tribal community values?

### Visuals

*Figure 1.* Top five clusters with novelty-impact positioning. We‚Äôre drafting spotlight cards for each one.

## Final Share Out ‚Äî Insights & Sharing
*Focus: synthesize signals, highlight the top wildcard prototypes, outline hand-offs.*

![Team 20 with the first atlas draft](assets/team_photo.jpg)
[Raw photo location: team_photo.jpg](https://github.com/CU-ESIIL/wildcard-topic-innovation-summit-2025__20/blob/main/docs/assets/team_photo.jpg)

### Findings at a glance üì£
- **Three clusters account for 60% of wildcard excitement:** community sensing, generative storytelling, and rapid mutual-aid logistics.
- **Low-effort data packaging unlocks action:** publishing CSV + thumbnails let three partner teams request follow-up conversations immediately.
- **Summit alumni want a shared backlog:** half of survey respondents volunteered to champion at least one wildcard if we keep the atlas updated.

### Visuals that tell the story üì£

### What‚Äôs next? üì£
- Finalize two-page atlas brief and share with summit organizers + CU leadership.
- Host a 45-minute virtual ideation to assign owners for the top three wildcard prototypes.
- Coordinate with CyVerse staff to pilot a persistent ‚ÄúWildcard backlog‚Äù workspace for the 2025 cohort.
