**One sentence on impact:** In three days we surface wildcard ideas from across the Innovation Summit and translate them into prototypes, visuals, and next-step pilots that decision makers can act on.

## How to use this page (for the team)
- **Edit this file:** `docs/index.md` ‚Üí ‚úé ‚Üí change text ‚Üí **Commit changes**.
- **Add images:** upload to `docs/assets/` and reference like `assets/your_file.png`.
- Keep **text short** and **visuals first**. Think ‚Äústoryboard captions,‚Äù not full reports.

## Day 1 ‚Äî Define & Explore
*Focus: frame the wildcard opportunity, align on product, capture early signals.*

### Our product üì£
- A ‚ÄúWildcard Atlas‚Äù showcasing high-potential summit ideas, ranked by novelty and readiness, with prototype screenshots and follow-up owners.

### Our question(s) üì£
- How might we collect, tag, and cluster wildcard proposals generated during the summit in near real time?
- Which ideas create the biggest leaps for climate adaptation if advanced quickly?
- What story or artifact will motivate partners to keep co-developing after the event?

### Hypotheses / intentions
- We think that combining rapid text clustering with facilitator notes will reveal cross-team themes nobody sees in the room.
- We intend to test whether lightweight scoring (novelty √ó feasibility √ó impact) helps prioritize the most promising experiments.
- We will know we‚Äôre onto something if teams start referencing the atlas during share-outs or requesting deeper dives.

### Why this matters (the ‚Äúupshot‚Äù) üì£
Summit days move fast; promising ideas disappear without a shared hub. Packaging wildcard concepts with clear owners and next steps keeps momentum going, informs funding conversations, and signals where infrastructure support is required.

### Inspirations (papers, datasets, tools)
- Publication: [Wild Cards in Climate Change Adaptation](https://library.wmo.int/idurl/4/51141)
- Dataset portal: [Innovation Summit Group 20 community folder](https://de.cyverse.org/data/ds/iplant/home/shared/esiil/Innovation_summit/Group_20?type=folder&resourceId=0ec57af4-95a3-11f0-b0fb-90e2ba675364)
- Tool/tech: [BERTopic for emergent theme detection](https://github.com/MaartenGr/BERTopic)

### Field notes / visuals

*Caption: Mapping questions from the first round of ideation to identify gaps in our wildcard atlas.*

> **Different perspectives:** We debated whether to focus on one flagship prototype or map the broader landscape. The atlas approach won because it keeps doors open for other teams to plug in.

---

## Day 2 ‚Äî Data & Methods
*Focus: ingest submissions, prototype clustering + scoring, ship a first visual.*

### Data sources we‚Äôre exploring üì£
- **CyVerse form exports (CSV)** ‚Äî structured responses from the summit intake form with text summaries, stage, and contact info.

  ![First look at wildcard clustering output](assets/explore_data_plot.png)
[Raw photo location: explore_data_plot.png](https://github.com/CU-ESIIL/wildcard-topic-innovation-summit-2025__20/blob/main/docs/assets/explore_data_plot.png)
  *Snapshot: BERTopic clusters highlighting recurring needs around monitoring, storytelling, and rapid response.*

- **Facilitator note uploads (Markdown)** ‚Äî qualitative summaries from each session (internal link in community folder).
- **Lightning talk slides (PDF)** ‚Äî quick cues for visuals to include in the atlas.

### Methods / technologies we‚Äôre testing üì£
- Semantic embedding of idea descriptions with SentenceTransformers + BERTopic.
- Lightweight scoring model that blends facilitator rankings with novelty heuristics.
- Observable-style prototype for the ‚ÄúWildcard Atlas‚Äù landing page (embedded via iframe screenshot for now).

### Challenges identified
- Not all submissions include clear geographic or beneficiary info, making scoring harder.
- Slides are graphics-heavy; extracting text for clustering requires extra preprocessing.
- Coordinating permissions for idea owners before publishing summaries.

### Visuals

## Final Share Out ‚Äî Insights & Sharing
*Focus: synthesize signals, highlight the top wildcard prototypes, outline hand-offs.*

[Raw photo location: team_photo.jpg](https://github.com/CU-ESIIL/wildcard-topic-innovation-summit-2025__20/blob/main/docs/assets/team_photo.jpg)

### Findings at a glance üì£
- **Three clusters account for 60% of wildcard excitement:** community sensing, generative storytelling, and rapid mutual-aid logistics.
- **Low-effort data packaging unlocks action:** publishing CSV + thumbnails let three partner teams request follow-up conversations immediately.
- **Summit alumni want a shared backlog:** half of survey respondents volunteered to champion at least one wildcard if we keep the atlas updated.

### Visuals that tell the story üì£

### What‚Äôs next? üì£
- Finalize two-page atlas brief and share with summit organizers + CU leadership.
- Host a 45-minute virtual ideation to assign owners for the top three wildcard prototypes.
- Coordinate with CyVerse staff to pilot a persistent ‚ÄúWildcard backlog‚Äù workspace for the 2025 cohort.
