# Updates

We use this log to record milestones, decisions, and outstanding needs. Add an entry whenever something notable happens so we can reconstruct the sprint story later.

## 2025-01-13 — Day 1 kickoff
- Defined the problem framing and agreed to build a “Wildcard Atlas” instead of a single flagship prototype.
- Captured 42 idea submissions from intake forms and whiteboard notes.
- Assigned Avery (lead), Jordan (data), Sky (comms), Morgan (partners), and Taylor (tech) as primary contacts.

## 2025-01-14 — Day 2 experimentation
- Jordan ran the first BERTopic clustering pass; early clusters showed strong signals around community sensing and narrative tooling.
- Sky mocked up atlas card layouts using outputs from `code/single_hull_demo.py`.
- Morgan coordinated with summit organizers to confirm sharing permissions for idea owners.

## 2025-01-15 — Day 3 share-out prep
- Finalized scoring rubric (novelty × feasibility × impact) and published preliminary rankings on the homepage.
- Embedded the lightning talk recap video and exported figures for the story walkthrough.
- Drafted the follow-up plan to keep the atlas alive post-summit.

## Backlog / needs
- [ ] Automate daily exports from the intake form to avoid manual CSV downloads.
- [ ] Schedule usability testing with three summit mentors to validate atlas navigation.
- [ ] Add anonymized case studies to the documentation folder for future cohorts.
